# taskTimeLogger
Log what you are working on and have it automatically save to a CSV file. 

I built this project because I wanted a way to log how much time I was spending on different tasks, and also to demonstrate some C# skills. 

You can download a compiled version, with the installer, from my Amazon S3 bucket. Available here

https://stargarnet.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/TaskLogger.zip

Once you download it and unzip it (this is simulating getting the program on a disk), use the "setup" program to install the program. 

It will say that the publisher cannot be verified, but that is okay because it is just me. 

The program will be available in your start folder as "TaskTimeLogger". You can also uninstall it at any time just like a normal program.

The idea is that you set a file path (an example is shown) to where you want to log your tasks, it will then deposit your task with timestamp in CSV format. You can later view this data in excel.
